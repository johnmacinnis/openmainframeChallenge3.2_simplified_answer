A most elegant solution using Typescript to automate json to csv conversion + the Zowe API Visual Studio plugin to access the IBM sponsored mainframe - by the code master/challenger here https://medium.com/@jessielaine.punongbayan/solution-covid-19-reports-cobol-challenge-6c509579e3fe

Zowe does a very nice job bringing the VS IDE experience to z/OS mainfraime COBOL. IBM made free mainframe access availble for the 'COBOL Programming with VSCode' challenge. The access included a Zowe interface for working through the program with VSCode. Very nice however only availble on a limited basis.  

If like me, you are renting $50/mo access from a commercial mainframe provider, the Zowe interface is generally not available. No problem. Here I show a simple solution to this challenge using only ISPF and mainframe COBOL from a standard mainframe access provider.
